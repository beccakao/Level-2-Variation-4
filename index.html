		<h1>I know why the caged bird sings</h1>
		<h3>Maya Angelou</h3>
		<h6>A free bird leaps on the back </h6><h6> &nbsp Of the wind and floats downstream </h6><h6> &nbsp &nbsp Till the current ends and dips his wing </h6><h6> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In the orange suns rays </h6><h5> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And dares to claim the sky.</h5>
		<h5>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp But a BIRD that stalks down his narrow cage </h5><h5> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Can seldom see through his bars of rage </h5><h5> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp His wings are clipped and his feet are tied </h5><h4> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp So he opens his throat to sing.</h4>
		<h4>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The caged bird sings with a fearful trill </h4><h4> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Of things unknown but longed for still </h4><h4> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And his tune is heard on the distant hill for </h4><h3> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The caged bird sings of freedom.</h3>
		<h3>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The free bird thinks of another breeze </h3><h3> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And the trade winds soft through </h3><h3> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The sighing trees </h3><h2> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And the fat worms waiting on a dawn-bright </h2><h2> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lawn and he names the sky his own.</h2>
		<h2>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp But a caged BIRD stands on the grave of dreams </h2><h2> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp His shadow shouts on a nightmare scream </h2><h1> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp His wings are clipped and his feet are tied </h1><h1>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp So he opens his throat to sing.</h1>
